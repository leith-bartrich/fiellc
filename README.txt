fiellc
By Bradley Friedman, FIE LLC

Commands and plugins for fiellc to operate.

Also serves as a demonstration of a formal company custom implementation/command.

Various plugins may be included in this package at any point.  Over time,
they will likely migrate to their own packages as they mature.
This also serves to show how an entity might develop their own internal
tech easily, but still keep an eye toward wider adoption at a later point,
by developing it as a plugin that just happens to be internal to the entity's
package.

Current Internal Plugins:
FreeCAD - Pipeline integration for FreeCAD - https://www.freecadweb.org/
3DCoat - Pipeline integration for 3DCoat - https://3dcoat.com/home/
FBXLib - Pipeline plugin for a generic library of FBX files. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBX
